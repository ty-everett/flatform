Welcome to the FlatForm repo!

FlatForm is a java-based 2D 1980's-style platformer! I've added animations, sounds, and a state-based rendering system!
This is a project I worked on in march-may 2016, and I might start work on it again if I get some help with designing better graphics.

features:
enemies
bullets
collision
sounds
animated sprites
ladders
image-based map rendering
powerup buttons (Q for health, E for explode)

what I could use some help with
graphics
animation
adding more levels (and more complex level design)
doing collision detection the "right" way
